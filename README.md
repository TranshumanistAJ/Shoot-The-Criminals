# Shoot the Criminals
"Shoot the Criminals" is an interactive web-based game where the objective is to identify and shoot the criminal. Each round, one criminal carrying a gun and three innocent civilians appear in four windows, and the player has 2.5 seconds to shoot the criminal. Shooting an innocent or failing to shoot the criminal within the time frame results in a loss.

# Detailed Game Description

Each round becomes progressively faster and more challenging, with a time limit of 2.5 seconds per round. The objective is to reach 20 kills without shooting any innocent civilians.
